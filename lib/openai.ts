Keep it natural and encouraging - write it like a caring friend would text. Think:
- Warm, friendly tone (like texting a good friend)
- Natural, conversational language
- Can include 1-2 emojis if it feels natural
- Max 2 short sentences
- Should feel supportive but not preachy
- Reference their goal/motivation naturally
- Avoid anything that sounds like a motivational poster

Style guide:
- Write like a caring friend
- Be supportive without being over-the-top
- No corporate/motivational speaker vibes
- Keep it genuine and relatable

Just the message, no quotes.`;
